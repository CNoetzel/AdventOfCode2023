# Advent of code 2023

This repository contains my solutions for [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Usage

Install requirements via `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
Afterwards you should be able to execute single days via `python3 challenges/dayX.py`.

## Testing

To execute all tests run `pytest` or `pytest tests/test_dayX.py` for a single day.

## Notes

- Day 5 Task 2 is brute forcing the solution so execution time is loooooong
